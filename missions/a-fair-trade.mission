This is a little embarrassing, it's personal, and I'm not sure how to explain... You see, my husband and I are pregnant with our first children, but ever since I transferred the embryos to his abdominal sac, he's been very emotional.  I spent some of our resources on this cool new fighter craft, and I haven't even been able to fly it!  Anyway, in the interests of marital harmony, if you'd like to take this off my hands in exchange for some gold, cider, and energy, I think I'll be able to use it to make it up to him before the babies are born.  Don't ask how, I think I've given enough details already... you have no idea how grumpy a man with several dozen spawn growing inside him can be!","max_university_level":"20"}

I am Prince Rokan VII of Khrysiria.  I've recently made a small error that I'm hoping you can help me with.  I'm big enough to admit my mistakes, you see, and recently when making an acquisition to support my family's atomic arsenal, I committed such an error.  I agreed to purchase what I thought was a middling quantity of uraninite, but after the transaction was complete, it seems I had acquired a uraninite glyph.  Now a glyph is a fine bauble, but it won't put warheads on our snarks.  If you would care to enter into this exchange with me, I can offer you the glyph in exchange for, say, 80 thousand units of uraninite.","mission_type":"trade","name":"It Makes a Nice Paperweight","max_university_level":"15"}

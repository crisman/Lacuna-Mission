{"network_19_headline":"q infestation on Lukram 4 reaches epidemic proportions.","network_19_completion":"The government of Lukram 4 acknowledges %s's aid in controlling the beeldeban population.","description":"Greetings from Lukram 4.  This year a strange mutation in our beeldeban population has caused them to multiply beyond our control, overrunning our ranches.  They quickly consumed all of the Denton Root available on our planet, and have now moved on to other less-desirable foods, putting us at the brink of an agricultural collapse.  The most expedient way to deal with the outbreak is through the use of a specially-developed genetic inhibitor drug which requires a large amount of fluorite to produce.  We will then also need an import of Denton Root to use as bait so that the beeldeban will ingest the pesticides.  If you can provide 20,000 each of root and fluorite, we will happily exchange this for 25,000 each of energy and water.","mission_objective":{"resources":{"fluorite":20000,"root":20000}},"max_university_level":"20","name":"Infestation","mission_reward":{"resources":{"energy":25000,"water":25000}},"mission_type":"trade"}
